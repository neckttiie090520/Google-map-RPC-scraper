It’s a great place to shop for both luxury brands and local Thai labels. The mall is big, clean, and beautifully designed — perfect for walking around and exploring. There are so many restaurants and cafes to choose from, and there’s almost always an event going on. I also love that it’s connected by a walking bridge to nearby areas, which makes it super convenient to get around. Definitely a must-visit spot when in Bangkok!",1

Good for window shopping. The electric equipment’s prices are really good here but shoe prices are way higher than it should be. Nice place to roam around as a tourist. Need cash card to buy food is the only thing I struggled personally apart from that everything is ok.,1

It’s huge, and every time I go I feel like there’s something new to discover. One of the highlights for me is the larger UNIQLO, which has way more variety than most other locations, making it fun to browse through for clothes. And of course, I can never leave without grabbing a snack at Auntie Anne’s, which has become a little tradition for me there. With its size, variety, and energy, Central World really feels like a place where you can spend hours and never run out of things to do.",1

Lot of big name stores such as Victoria Secret, Gentle Monster, Marimeko, Sephora etc. Plenty of cafes & dining venues throughout the different floors. There is also a large area of food court & a supermarket. We enjoyed lots of window shopping. Also stopped for lunch at a restaurant by the food court. Everything was delicious & fresh.

A bit on the high pricey side but worth it and you can be there for hours shopping and eating. They have everything you want and need from food to electronics to pharmacy goods, toileteries, snacks, dessert, bubble tea, toys etc. disabled friendly and child friendly. It is massive and you can get lost there. The air conditioning is good and it’s a nice reprieve from the stifling heat or a good place to spend time when it is raining buckets. Been here way too many times since 2007",1

It’s none stop connections after connections. Floors after floors. Stores after stores. Every type and every style, from your mom and pa shop, family business to all the name brands you can think of. The traffic is ridiculously busy. Cars and people are like ants 🐜, nonstop, it’s unbelievable. Will I come back probably but maybe figure out a different drop off and pick up spot, avoid the main entrances. It’s a mess! It’s a much better shopping center than ICONSIAM. Way more things to do.",1

Being so easily accessible makes it a popular destination with a high footfall every day. 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️ 🛍️ Endless Shopping Options for Every Style & Budget The mall is huge — it can easily take 4 to 5 hours to explore fully! You'll find a wide variety of stores, ranging from luxury brands to more budget-friendly options, making it ideal for every type of shopper. Whether you're looking for fashion, tech, home goods, or gifts, this place has it all. 👜👟📱 🍜 Diverse Dining Options Across Two Floors The 6th and 7th floors are entirely dedicated to food, and there are plenty of options for every taste and budget — from local street-style dishes to international cuisine. 🍱🍕🍔 However, one important note for those with dietary restrictions: 🔸 Most restaurants serve pork, which may not be suitable for everyone. 🔸 If you are looking for halal food, there is one halal-certified restaurant located on the 6th floor, and another spot that serves only beef ramen, which may be a safe option for some. 🍜✅ 🥢 Fresh, Flavorful Asian Cuisine As someone who enjoys Asian cuisine, I was delighted by the freshness and taste of the Asian dishes I tried. Everything was served hot, quickly, and full of flavor. If you're a fan of sushi, ramen, or wok-style meals, you’ll love it here. 🍣🌶️🍚 😊 Friendly Staff & Quick Service The service was very satisfying: Staff were polite, well-dressed, and cheerful Most team members speak adequate English, making communication much easier for international visitors Tables were clean, and the whole environment felt organized despite the crowd 🧼💬 Fast service and a professional attitude made the experience even better! ✅ Final Thoughts This mall combines convenience, variety, and quality in a single destination. I will definitely be returning for both shopping and dining. Whether you're a tourist, an expat, or a local, this place is well worth a visit. Highly recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",1

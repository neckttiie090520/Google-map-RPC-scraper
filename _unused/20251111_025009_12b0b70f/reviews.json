Press the button on your table and the staff is there within seconds to help you with anything you'd need. The chicken sate came with one of the best sauce I have ever tasted. The pork egg rolls were yummy and the Kao Soy was spicy and delicious. The drinks are good too, definitely worth a try!",

    "review_text": "This isn't my first time here at Kao Soy Nimman but it is my first time dropping the review. I've tried Kao soy from so many places around Chiang Mai, but honestly, Kao Soy Nimman is the best one yet. I get why it’s so famous...and now I 100% agree with all the hype 👍 The broth is rich, creamy, not too thick or liquidly and it's full of flavor, the noodles are perfectly cooked, and that crispy topping adds the perfect crunch. Everything just comes together so well. **Don't underestimate their chilli** Even though it’s already super popular with both locals and tourists, it really deserves the extra fame. If you’re in Chiang Mai and want to taste the best Kao Soy OR Khao Soi, this is the spot. Totally recommend! 👍",

Because of its fame, it's almost always crowded, so it's common to find a small queue at the entrance.Luckily, the line moved quickly, and we didn't wait long to be seated. The service was good and attentive. We tried the famous Khao Soi: it was tasty, and the ingredients seemed high-quality, but honestly, it wasn't excellent. Given the restaurant's reputation, I was expecting a bit more. It's good, but not the best I've had. They accept card payments.",

The Khao Soi had rich standard coconut curry broth, crispy noodles on top, and super tender chicken. The balance of spice, creaminess, and a squeeze of lime was just perfect. The Satay Peanut Noodles were such a nice surprise!!!! creamy, nutty, slightly sweet, with grilled chicken that had that smoky flavor 9/10. A great fusion of comfort food and Thai street style. Nice cozy spot with warm Chiang Mai vibes. Perfect for anyone who loves flavorful northern Thai food. Highly recommend adding this place to your food list when you’re in town! Food looks as good as it tastes check the photos that I took here.",

Its consistency struck the right note as well, being neither too thick nor too watery. The two types of noodles, one firm and the other soft, added depth and variety to each bite. Midway through, the topping of lemon slices, onions, and pickled vegetables refreshed the flavor, making the bowl enjoyable from start to finish. Although about ten people were waiting outside, our turn came in just around 20 minutes.",

    "review_text": "This restaurant deserves to get its first Michelin star! All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed. I can assure everyone that you will enjoy your meal here to the highest level!",

After being seated, we had to call someone after 15 minutes because no one seemed to want to take our order. No hello. The staff waits for orders with their arms behind their backs against trees or walls. We chose to try the kao soy because we know it well. What a surprise when the dish arrived, we would have said half a portion with say 5 tablespoons of sauce maximum. Also, we decided to try a dessert. Likewise, no one came to ask us if we wanted something... yet many staff were available and we had to call them. And as you can see from the pictures, no one cleared the meal / table before and during dessert. There are other places much better in terms of taste, service and price in Chang Mai.",

Northern Thai sausage platter was average in textures and taste but the dips made up for it. The chicken satay was nice enough but nothing special. The black rice is like a Bak chang so not a fan. Pork floss and onion ring were quite nice. Pork rind was normal. Calamari batter was not sticking and while crispy lacked flavour. Service was a bit slow when getting the bill.

    "review_text": "This bustling Northern Thai eatery delivers a lively, tourist-friendly intro to Kao Soi. The Super Bowl featured an assortment of grilled pork, chicken leg, and squid which offers a creamy, slightly sweet coconut-curry broth with firm egg noodles is approachable for newcomers, though purists might miss traditional depth. Portions are generous, and seating was immediate during our 2pm visit. Don’t skip the aromatic chicken satay skewers - tender white meat with a zesty chili-shallot dip. Highlights include the crab shell roe (tiny but intensely savory) and the peeled coconut—a refreshing, Instagrammable orb in a chilled metal cup. The vibe is energetic, with English menus and swift service, though prices lean higher than local joints. The ambience was pretty with all the overhanging ferns and plants however seated outdoors, there were a little too many flies around for comfort. Small eaters can share the Super Bowl (it’s huge!), skip the crab roe unless craving novelty, and visit mid-afternoon to avoid crowds. Ideal for first-timers seeking a hassle-free Kao Soi experience, but seasoned diners might prefer hole-in-the-wall authenticity. Still, a solid choice for flavorful, filling meals in a vibrant setting.",

    "review_text": "Housed in trendy Nimman, this is one of Chiang Mai’s Michelin-picked noodle playground that gives a modern spin to the Northern Thai classic: khao soi—a dish rooted in Lanna history, once brought over by Chinese-Muslim traders, now a Chiang Mai must-eat. Kicked things off with the Octopus Khao Soi—because why be normal when you can have tentacles in your soup? The octopus was chewy, not salty and a little bougie in the best way laying on top of a coconut curry hot tub. Then came the classic hero: the Chicken Khao Soi. A+ comfort food. That broth? Creamy, warm, just the right punch of spice. At some parts, the slurping was wishing the broth had just one more ladle of richness. Ended with a tropical pool party where the Thub Thim Krob came in like a treasure chest disguised as a dessert bowl.Signature ruby water chestnuts (crunchy, chewy, glorious) Grass jelly, cendol, and nata de coco and golden jackfruit pieces all vibing in one icy, sweet coconut milk party. Was definitely pleasing to the eyes but flavour wise went a little under. Still—worth the visit, especially if you’re khao soi-curious or full-on obsessed with the michelin adventure! Zoom off with a grab-bike ride that gives u more than local vibes 😉",

    "review_text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5 stars rating) I recently had dinner at “Kao Soy Nimman” with my partner, and it was a mixed experience. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was inviting and cozy, with a delightful blend of traditional Thai decor and efficient but unattractive (to the point) service —we got no help with recommendations and had to call service several times. 🌿✨ Let's start with the beverages. Despite their small selection, the fresh coconut water was refreshing, and the tea was perfect for the appetizers. 🍹🍵 The regular beers were also cold and refreshing. As for the food, it was truly spectacular! Each dish was a testament to Thai culinary craftsmanship. The “Mo Wah Pork Jerky” was expertly done, with a perfect caramelization that added a delightful sweetness and crunch to every bite. 🍖💎 The highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the “Kai Soy Stewed Beef.” The creamy sauce was nothing short of delicious, and the beef was tender and flavorful, melting in our mouths with each bite. It was a dish that left us craving more. 🍲🐄 We also ordered the “Pork Beef Grilled,” which, although flavorful, had a bit more fat than we preferred. However, the rich taste of the meat more than compensated for this slight inconvenience. 🥩🔥 Overall, \"Kao Soy Nimman\" delivered a mixed dining experience, with nice Thai food but regular service and restaurant atmosphere. We would recommend it when looking for something quick and delicious, no fancy or exotic ! 🌟🇹🇭 Pros: - Delicious and well-prepared dishes 🍽️ - Quick service - Inviting and cozy atmosphere 🌿 - Authentic Thai flavors 🇹🇭 Cons: - Short selection of beverage 🍹 - Brief and to the point service, unattractive or unwelcoming (we had to ask constantly, empty plates were there until asked to be removed)",

Kai Soy tastes just fair and in small portions. Fresh coconut juice is in nice presentation but of unstable quality. Young and soft coconut meat for the first order but old and very hard meat for the second order. There is a service bell on the table. Funny sound of pressing it, lol. Tried a few time but no waiter responded to it. You still have to wave your hands for service. Beware of mosquitoes bites if you sit outside. Bathroom is quite terrible. Dirty sewage everywhere.",

You can order it almost any way that you like, with or without meat. They offer Kao Soi with tofu, mushrooms, or just vegetables for all of us vegetarians. There are other vegetarian options on their menu, also. We really enjoyed the vegetable Thai omelette! Very delicious! It’s a busy place because it is so popular, so arrive early if you don’t like to wait. Service was very good because every table has a call button for the waiters, and they always respond almost immediately. Prices were very good, too. We will definitely return here and recommend this place to others.",

The portions are VERY small and the price is high for what they offer. I found this khao soi very mediocre. It’s not bad. It is just nothing special at all. I believe this place is overrated and I had a feeling it would be… but I decided to give it a try and believe in the reviews. I was wrong. People keep coming because there are some good reviews and, if they had not had a chance of actually having a good thai meal or a rich khao soi, they would think this one is good. Believe me, its not. And if you come to this restaurant and there is a line, dont wast your precious time.",

Tables were re-purposed from old sewing machines. Eight of us had a bowl of the famous Kao Soy Kai (curry noddlenwith chicken leg), as well as some side dishes to share: steamed herbal beef shank, chicken satay, kai jeow moo sab (minced pork Thai omelette). The Kao Soy Kai is a mixture of crispy noodle and normal yellow noodle. Blended well curiously. The ingredients were fresh, and the meat dishes were cooked well. We also ordered a drink each, and some dessert to share. Disappointed that the mango sticky rice was sold out. Price wise, it is reasonable: total of about 2,800 baht or 350 baht per person.",

This was fine, there was no pressure to 'free' the table, we had drinks while we waited.. 1 x beer and 1 x Grass Jelly Juice (A strange drink as it came in a bowl filled with ice and jelly strips that resembles slugs and a dark liquid, but it was quite refreshing - needed both a straw and a spoon). Our friends arrived, and food was ordered.... 3 x Kao Soy Stewed Beef, 1x Kao Soy Poo-Nim ( which is a soft-shelled crab dish), Sai Oua (this is spicy sausage), Kai Satay (chicken on skewers with peanutbutter sauce). More drinks: another Beer, Soda Water and 2 x Passion Fruit Juices. The dishes were delicious.. really good fresh, tasty food. The prices seemed reasonable, we did eat a lot (a dish each and 2 shared dishes plus 1 or 2 drinks each) and the bill came to baht 1275.. that's about baht 320 each. The atmosphere was lively, there was a lot of staff around to help, and they were so polite and efficient. We will be returning to try other dishes on the menu.",

Guess it lives up to its Michelin Guide recognition, with a queue forming even before the shop opens. The beef khao soi was especially delicious, with super tender meat. The chicken thigh version was good too, though I preferred the beef. The fried egg with pork was just okay. Coconut was fresh!",

Michelin recognition attests to its quality and consistent appeal among locals and tourists. Khao soi itself is significant in Chiang Mai and Northern Thailand, known for its coconut-based curry broth, rich spices, and soft-crunchy noodle texture. A unique fusion of Thai and Burmese culinary influences, khao soi is cherished as a warm, hearty dish and has become an iconic part of Chiang Mai’s food culture, symbolizing local heritage and flavor. While it’s tourist-friendly and conveniently located, some visitors feel it’s slightly pricier than local spots nearby. It’s a recommended stop for travelers looking to try authentic Thai flavors.",

One of the skewers is raw inside, notified staff. Staff was apologetic and offered not to charge the satay. Hopefully, i won't get food poisoning 🥲😭 Butterfly pea flower lime juice: refreshing",

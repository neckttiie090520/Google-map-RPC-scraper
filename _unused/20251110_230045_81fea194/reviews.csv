I've tried Kao soy from so many places around Chiang Mai, but honestly, Kao Soy Nimman is the best one yet. I get why it’s so famous...and now I 100% agree with all the hype 👍 The broth is rich, creamy, not too thick or liquidly and it's full of flavor, the noodles are perfectly cooked, and that crispy topping adds the perfect crunch. Everything just comes together so well. **Don't underestimate their chilli** Even though it’s already super popular with both locals and tourists, it really deserves the extra fame. If you’re in Chiang Mai and want to taste the best Kao Soy OR Khao Soi, this is the spot. Totally recommend! 👍",1

The Khao Soi had rich standard coconut curry broth, crispy noodles on top, and super tender chicken. The balance of spice, creaminess, and a squeeze of lime was just perfect.

Everything was nice enough except the calamari. Kao soy was like a Malaysian curry mee (not laksa) with a thicker and plainer broth. The noodles and crunch is nice though. The silkworms were nice and crispy with a bit of salt flavour. Northern Thai sausage platter was average in textures and taste but the dips made up for it. The chicken satay was nice enough but nothing special. The black rice is like a Bak chang so not a fan. Pork floss and onion ring were quite nice. Pork rind was normal. Calamari batter was not sticking and while crispy lacked flavour. Service was a bit slow when getting the bill. Had to ask 3 different people before we got the bill.",1

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean.

Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed. I can assure everyone that you will enjoy your meal here to the highest level!",31

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

The chicken satay was nice enough but nothing special. The black rice is like a Bak chang so not a fan. Pork floss and onion ring were quite nice. Pork rind was normal.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed. I can assure everyone that you will enjoy your meal here to the highest level!",40

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean.

Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed. I can assure everyone that you will enjoy your meal here to the highest level!",65

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

The chicken satay was nice enough but nothing special. The black rice is like a Bak chang so not a fan. Pork floss and onion ring were quite nice. Pork rind was normal.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean.

Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level.

The silkworms were nice and crispy with a bit of salt flavour. Northern Thai sausage platter was average in textures and taste but the dips made up for it. The chicken satay was nice enough but nothing special. The black rice is like a Bak chang so not a fan. Pork floss and onion ring were quite nice. Pork rind was normal.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

The chicken satay was nice enough but nothing special. The black rice is like a Bak chang so not a fan. Pork floss and onion ring were quite nice. Pork rind was normal. Calamari batter was not sticking and while crispy lacked flavour. Service was a bit slow when getting the bill. Had to ask 3 different people before we got the bill.",120

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed. I can assure everyone that you will enjoy your meal here to the highest level!",124

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

The chicken satay was nice enough but nothing special. The black rice is like a Bak chang so not a fan. Pork floss and onion ring were quite nice. Pork rind was normal.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere.

For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed. I can assure everyone that you will enjoy your meal here to the highest level!",140

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level.

The silkworms were nice and crispy with a bit of salt flavour. Northern Thai sausage platter was average in textures and taste but the dips made up for it. The chicken satay was nice enough but nothing special. The black rice is like a Bak chang so not a fan. Pork floss and onion ring were quite nice. Pork rind was normal. Calamari batter was not sticking and while crispy lacked flavour. Service was a bit slow when getting the bill. Had to ask 3 different people before we got the bill.",145

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed.

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed. I can assure everyone that you will enjoy your meal here to the highest level!",149

Actually, I think the KHAO SoI weren't as good as I expected; everyone has their own preferences. I am more like to eat that noodle I’m tried at Chiang Rai. KHAO Soi 4 Stars Iced Dessert 5 Stars!!!! Chicken Satay 3 Stars Ong Pu 1 Stars (This is not something I would eat.) Staff Service Good & Helpful",1

Because of its fame, it's almost always crowded, so it's common to find a small queue at the entrance.Luckily, the line moved quickly, and we didn't wait long to be seated. The service was good and attentive. We tried the famous Khao Soi: it was tasty, and the ingredients seemed high-quality, but honestly, it wasn't excellent. Given the restaurant's reputation, I was expecting a bit more. It's good, but not the best I've had. They accept card payments.",1

I've tried Kao soy from so many places around Chiang Mai, but honestly, Kao Soy Nimman is the best one yet. I get why it’s so famous...and now I 100% agree with all the hype 👍 The broth is rich, creamy, not too thick or liquidly and it's full of flavor, the noodles are perfectly cooked, and that crispy topping adds the perfect crunch. Everything just comes together so well. **Don't underestimate their chilli** Even though it’s already super popular with both locals and tourists, it really deserves the extra fame. If you’re in Chiang Mai and want to taste the best Kao Soy OR Khao Soi, this is the spot. Totally recommend! 👍",1

The Khao Soi had rich standard coconut curry broth, crispy noodles on top, and super tender chicken. The balance of spice, creaminess, and a squeeze of lime was just perfect. The Satay Peanut Noodles were such a nice surprise!!!! creamy, nutty, slightly sweet, with grilled chicken that had that smoky flavor 9/10. A great fusion of comfort food and Thai street style. Nice cozy spot with warm Chiang Mai vibes. Perfect for anyone who loves flavorful northern Thai food. Highly recommend adding this place to your food list when you’re in town!

All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed. I can assure everyone that you will enjoy your meal here to the highest level!",1

The spiciness of the soup was perfectly balanced—neither overpowering nor too mild. Its consistency struck the right note as well, being neither too thick nor too watery. The two types of noodles, one firm and the other soft, added depth and variety to each bite. Midway through, the topping of lemon slices, onions, and pickled vegetables refreshed the flavor, making the bowl enjoyable from start to finish.

I think there is a management problem in this restaurant. After being seated, we had to call someone after 15 minutes because no one seemed to want to take our order. No hello. The staff waits for orders with their arms behind their backs against trees or walls. We chose to try the kao soy because we know it well. What a surprise when the dish arrived, we would have said half a portion with say 5 tablespoons of sauce maximum. Also, we decided to try a dessert. Likewise, no one came to ask us if we wanted something... yet many staff were available and we had to call them. And as you can see from the pictures, no one cleared the meal / table before and during dessert. There are other places much better in terms of taste, service and price in Chang Mai.",1

Kicked things off with the Octopus Khao Soi—because why be normal when you can have tentacles in your soup? The octopus was chewy, not salty and a little bougie in the best way laying on top of a coconut curry hot tub. Then came the classic hero: the Chicken Khao Soi. A+ comfort food. That broth? Creamy, warm, just the right punch of spice. At some parts, the slurping was wishing the broth had just one more ladle of richness. Ended with a tropical pool party where the Thub Thim Krob came in like a treasure chest disguised as a dessert bowl.Signature ruby water chestnuts (crunchy, chewy, glorious) Grass jelly, cendol, and nata de coco and golden jackfruit pieces all vibing in one icy, sweet coconut milk party.

From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was inviting and cozy, with a delightful blend of traditional Thai decor and efficient but unattractive (to the point) service —we got no help with recommendations and had to call service several times. 🌿✨ Let's start with the beverages. Despite their small selection, the fresh coconut water was refreshing, and the tea was perfect for the appetizers. 🍹🍵 The regular beers were also cold and refreshing. As for the food, it was truly spectacular! Each dish was a testament to Thai culinary craftsmanship. The “Mo Wah Pork Jerky” was expertly done, with a perfect caramelization that added a delightful sweetness and crunch to every bite. 🍖💎 The highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the “Kai Soy Stewed Beef.” The creamy sauce was nothing short of delicious, and the beef was tender and flavorful, melting in our mouths with each bite. It was a dish that left us craving more. 🍲🐄 We also ordered the “Pork Beef Grilled,” which, although flavorful, had a bit more fat than we preferred. However, the rich taste of the meat more than compensated for this slight inconvenience. 🥩🔥 Overall, ""Kao Soy Nimman"" delivered a mixed dining experience, with nice Thai food but regular service and restaurant atmosphere. We would recommend it when looking for something quick and delicious, no fancy or exotic ! 🌟🇹🇭 Pros: - Delicious and well-prepared dishes 🍽️ - Quick service - Inviting and cozy atmosphere 🌿 - Authentic Thai flavors 🇹🇭 Cons: - Short selection of beverage 🍹 - Brief and to the point service, unattractive or unwelcoming (we had to ask constantly, empty plates were there until asked to be removed)",2

I had the red curry with chicken. It was very watered down so that even the spice could not save the dish. The chicken was more bone than meat. My boyfriend had a different dish where he had a whole chicken foot just laying in the meal. (See in the picture) Chicken was also more bone than meat and the vegetables were so chewy that you couldn’t really eat them. When we paid our bill and the waiter saw that we gave back two full plates of food he didn’t even ask if anything was wrong with it. To top it all off I had a belly ache the whole night which I’ve never had before here in Thailand after eating. Two stars and not one because the Passion fruit juice and chicken Sate were good.,6

Someone actually left while we were waiting and said he had been waiting for too long). The food is good and we enjoyed it especially the grilled beef (though you can get way cheaper and just as tasty at the street food carts) but the Kao Soy was underwhelming. I had the Kao Soy Super Bowl and the prawns (aka shrimp) in it had a papery texture like when you freeze and defrost seafood. Didn’t taste fresh. The chicken drumstick in there was moist but was surprisingly bland and lacked the flavour I have come to expect from northern Thai food. The broth was nice and spicy and overall it was a tasty meal but just not worth the very long wait and the prices (we got 4 dishes and 3 drinks). The best Kao Soy we had was one we made ourselves at Mama Noi Thai Cookery School so definitely try that out if you’re a foodie. You’ll get delicious food and learn how to make it on your own whilst having a fun experience. If you really want to try the food here then maybe order it to go so you can pick it up later without having to sit around waiting or see if you can order it to be delivered to your accommodation via Grab.,7

It was only later that we realized this place is Michelin-recommended—a pleasant surprise! We opted to sit outdoors, though indoor seating with air conditioning was available. Despite the hot weather, the standing fans kept the outdoor area comfortably cool. Initially, we planned to just have dessert, but the signature Khao Soi on the menu looked too appealing to resist, so we decided to share a bowl. We're glad we did! The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the Thai lime, onion, and salted vegetables added a unique twist that elevated the dish. For dessert, we ordered two options: the Passion and what I believe is called Chendo (though I’m not certain of the name). I preferred the Passion drink, which was refreshingly cool, though it wasn't as sour as I expected—it could have benefited from a stronger passion fruit flavor. The Chendo had a variety of ingredients, but it wasn't as fragrant or flavorful as similar desserts we’ve had back home.

However, by local standards, the pricing was indeed a bit on the higher side. We ordered the Khao Soi Stewed Beef, where the beef absorbed the delicious curry sauce, making it very flavorful, and the noodles were more elastic and chewy compared to others we've had elsewhere. We also tried the Rod Duan (fried bamboo worms), which had no strange taste but were instead filled with a bran-like aroma. We originally wanted to order grilled chicken, but customers at the next table who had ordered grilled chicken/pork/beef recommended we try the grilled beef, which proved to have an excellent flavor. Additionally, we tried the Thai Boiled Wild Mushrooms (Nam Prik Kha Hed Tob), which had a crisp texture and could be dipped in the provided Galangal Chili sauce, though I found that sauce to be a bit too spicy for me. For drinks, we tried Pennywort juice, Gardenia flower juice, and shelled coconut. Each had its unique flavor, but the portion sizes were quite small given the price. We avoided peak hours to escape the crowd and potential wait times, so during our visits, there were more servers than customers. They were all very enthusiastic and patient in introducing us to the dishes, and they responded quickly whenever we had questions or needed to add an order.

Be prepared to wait 20 - 30 min for a table during weekday lunchtime. The food was all too salty for me personally. The braised pork topping was nice though. Tender and flavourful. Noodle portions are very small for those with single topping. The one with assorted toppings had more noodles. I found the noodles rather soggy but that could be my personal preference (I like my noodles al dente). Soup was alright. Chicken skewers were tender but salty. Dessert with assorted toppings was tasty and refreshing. Outdoor seating can be quite warm. Staff can speak basic English (they could not understand my request not to give me a straw for the dessert),8

The restaurant's Khao Soi brings back nostalgic memories of local cuisine. Their secret recipe has been kept intact, maintaining the authentic flavors of Chiang Mai. The aroma of the broth is rich, and the perfect level of spiciness adds to the irresistible allure of this dish. Apart from Khao Soi, their other dishes are also worth trying.

Although not the best khao soi, it was pretty delicious! When we got there around lunch time, there was a huge line up! We contemplated waiting or not, but ultimately decided to since we were there anyways and we really wanted to try this place out. We got our number from the hostess and she told us there were 20 numbers ahead of us so we were prepared to wait for at least an hour. There is a bubble tea place right beside it so we ordered a bubble tea while we waited. To our surprise, the wait only took about 25 minutes! We got seated in the air-conditioned space at the back, which was good because it was such a hot day out! I ordered the chicken khao soi, my husband ordered the beef khao soi, and we also got the crispy wontons and steamed vegetables to share. The food came within 10 minutes, which was very reasonable. The khao soi tasted quite good, just the right amount of richness, and not too spicy. Since this place is so popular among tourists, we felt that perhaps the dish was not truly authentic, compared to some other khao soi we have tried. Delicious food nonetheless! The food was definitely tourist pricing since it was pricier than most other local restaurants, but we expected that going in so no surprises there. I would definitely return to this place if I find myself in Chiang Mai again, but I’d probably try to go a bit earlier to avoid the lunch time rush.",21

It has a very nice decor, comfortable and clean environment. There's indoor air conditioned seating and outdoor seating. Even seating outdoors, there's no pesky mosquitoes. There are many wait staff and they are attentive and helpful. There's a toilet and free wifi. However when it comes to the food, it's mediocre and i have had better khao soi in the basement of a fresh market and much cheaper too. The khao soi here is served in a porcelain bowl with the pickle, onion and lime wedge in a separate metal dish. One taste of the noodle, the soup was not hot(merely warm), noodle was too soft and the curry tasted a tad too sweet(not sour enough even with the lime). I ordered the thai omelette khao soi, the omelette itself was good and the fried egg noodles on top of the bowl were perfectly crispy and crunchy so props for those. Overall forgettable khao soi and it was more expensive than average (starts at 69 thb. I have had better khao soi at 40 thb). I went past the kitchen and noticed a big vat of curry boiling away on the stove so it doesn't make sense that it's merely warm. I then ordered a dessert(water chestnut with rubies in iced coconut milk) 40 thb. It came in a plastic container with a plastic straw and spoon stuck in the container. I try to avoid single use plastics and always have with me my own cutlery. Such an upscale place and they use single use plastics and chopsticks. Disappointing.

Kao Soy Nimman is a Michelin bib gourmand place which has definitely earned it much fame among tourists. We had to line up for about 30 minutes before being given a table, which isn’t a problem in itself. However, ONCE we got inside and placed our orders (one bowl of khao soi and one omelette), it took 40 minutes before the khao soi arrived. We made several requests to the staff about where our food was, but no one ever seemed to be able to definitively help. The khao soi took 40 minutes to arrive, but we waited about 70 minutes for the omelette and it never came. We ultimately decided we had spent too long in the restaurant, asked the waitress if we could cancel our omelette request (to which she kindly said yes), paid up and left. As for the khao soi, it was extremely bland and watered down, and the meat was tough and chewy. I have since eaten at Khao Soi Maesai and Khao Soi Lung Prakit Kad Kom (both Michelin bib gourmand places too), and their khao soi was incomparably better and the quality of the meat was far superior too. Not to mention, the prices at this restaurant are 3x those at the other two, but for what reason? This isn’t an agenda-driven review by any means, but simply an honest reflection of what I experienced. I hope it is helpful, especially to those of you who are considering visiting on a tight time schedule - you will not miss anything important by skipping this place.",19

We had a big khao soi that had a bit of everything in it and a standard bowl of beef khao soi, an extremely crispy fried egg with minced pork (wanted to try the ant eggs but the wife declined), and another bowl of soupy bamboo shoots with meat in it. As most of the food in the extensive menu (including a more exotic bamboo worms) were spicy, they provided a free plate of fried rice for our young daughter.

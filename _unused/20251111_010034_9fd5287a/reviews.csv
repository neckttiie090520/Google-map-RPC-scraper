The food is excellent, the environment is lively and lovely. The restaurant is so busy but staff are so attentive!! Staff make excellent recommendation of dishes without upselling their more expensive dishes or anything. We’ve had other Khao Soi, including Michelin guided shops but this is the best one for me and my husband. This may not be your everyday Khao Soi. We are tourists here and here to enjoy & experience things !! Worth every penny.",1

The khao soi was very spicy and cover the taste of shrimp and scallops. but the staff were extremely caring when he noticed I was sweating and can’t handle with the spicy, he proactively offered extra coconut milk and pork broth to mellow the soup. However, the yogurt dessert’s texture was too hard and not creamy enough. If you can handle the spicy soup, you might want to skip dessert at a khao soi restaurant 😆",1

I ate the Khao-soi with Braised Beef. Here you can choose to have your dish with spicy curry broth (traditional version), or you to have stir-fried noodles without broth and therefore not spicy. Before choosing, the waitress was very kind as she brought me a small bowl with a taste of the broth, so I could taste and understand how spicy it was. In the end, I chose to have it in soup format with broth and diluted it with coconut milk to tone down the spiciness. We ate very well, it’s a must-try dish to try if you are in Chiang Mai.",1

Honestly, the taste is pretty good, but personally, I prefer more local style places. That’s just my personal preference, so it wouldn’t be fair to judge the restaurant based on that. I recommend trying it yourself. Overall, it’s a good place definitely worth a visit if you’ve never had Khao Soi before.",1

The restaurant’s signature Khao Soi dish features a rich, creamy curry broth with a perfect balance of spices, complemented by tender meat and a combination of soft and crispy egg noodles and delicious dumplings. This harmonious blend of textures and flavors creates a memorable meal that captures the essence of Northern Thai cuisine. Beyond the food, Khao-Sō-i can be praised for its cozy and clean ambiance, as well as its attentive and friendly service. The toilet, though, needs fixing and renovation. Apart from that, the staff’s dedication to providing a welcoming atmosphere increases the overall dining experience, making everyone feel valued and comfortable. Whether you’re a resident or a traveler exploring Chiang Mai, Khao-Sō-i is a must-visit destination for an authentic and satisfying meal. There’s also a dessert section, where you can relax after your meal and choose from a selection of hot and cold drinks, cream caramel, tiramisu, and a Japanese dessert. All in all, it has been a great experience. I have wanted to try this restaurant, and I am very pleased to do so. If I don't visit again, I will miss the friendly staff.",1

Every dish is creative yet authentic, with a perfect balance of flavors that highlight the best of Japanese culture and Northern Thai cuisine. Truly one of a kind! The venue itself is nice, clean, and photogenic – great for both foodies and anyone who loves sharing their dining experiences. Prices are very reasonable for the quality you get, and the restaurant is clearly well managed. Add to that a spacious parking area and professional, attentive staff, and you’ve got the full package.

The price of Khao Soi is higher than local shops, but it's definitely worth for the food, service and cozy atmosphere. For vegetarian, there are only one option, the tofu Khao Soi. Without the chili paste, the Khao Soi itself is not very spicy. You can add as much chili as you like. The ice cream (mixed) is yummy 😋",1

Opted for the more premium Tajima Aus Khao Soi beef thinking it would be nice and tender. I could have stayed there chewing it all day and not gotten very far. Despite being the only ones there the order was wrong to what we marked on the order sheet but I was glad I got a small instead of medium in the end. Dumpling were nice. Chicken Khao Soi was good too. The place is nice and presentation also but not good value for money,1

I ordered Khao So I with Braised Beef and Beef Tendon size small with soup and mineral water. The place not big, not too crowd (so many foreigner, didnt see local there), easy to get seat. My order came fast, it really curry but not too spices. The small size look small, but its okay for me. You can add the coconut milk, chili flakes, vegetable and/or lime inside, but without all of that, the soup still yummy. Lime made it more fresh, i suggest u pour it. The meat was juicy and tender, but the meat portion not so many, but you can add topping. The staff also nice, can speak english, you can pay with QR.",1

I'd say this the best one i've tried so far, the flavor of the coconut and curry sauce is so rich. It's lowkey spicy for me without even adding the chili flakes.

The star of the show was definitely their signature Khao Soi — rich, creamy curry broth with tender beef and perfectly cooked egg noodles. The dish came with all the essential condiments: pickled mustard greens, red onions, fresh herbs, and crispy noodles — beautifully presented and thoughtfully portioned. The attention to detail was impressive, from the handcrafted ceramic dishes to the warm wooden tray that added a rustic charm. You can tell they care about both flavor and presentation. The ambiance was cozy and intimate, perfect for a relaxed meal with friends or a solo comfort food fix. Service was friendly and attentive. If you’re craving authentic Northern Thai cuisine in KL (or wherever you’re located), Khao So I is a must-visit. I’ll definitely be back to try more from their menu!",1

I ordered the small portion and it’s something like 240 baht. The problem is that 1. It’s definitely not enough for a male adult 2. I actually asked the server if it’s enough, and they recommended me the small portion 3. There’s really nothing special about the Khao so. The meat is indeed better than most random food stands, but that’s pretty much it 4. In fact, I felt a bit overwhelmed after the meal. Perhaps it’s that I’m just not a big fan of Khao soi. Still, this place is worth checking out, but not a must for sure",2

Recommend the beef tendon and shank soup dishes. We have also tried the pork fried rice. Matcha soft serve is so yummy! But they close down the machine around 7:30-8 pm or so. Order early! Note: • if you do not like spicy, get the dry noodles and ask for no spice. All soup based noodle dishes will be spicy. • if you require gluten free options, they do provide gluten free noodles but you must ask! The GF noodles were almost just as good as the original.

Very accessible to those who might not be as tolerant to spice, but preserves the authentic taste of northern Thailand who those who can with a Japanese twist. The service is spectacular, no notes.

We were contemplating if we should give it a try and the lovely staff was nice enough to give us a taste of the soup and to our surprise it’s way too much for us so we opted for the stir fry khao soi instead. Very tasty I love how tender the pork ribs 😋 but we’re kinda disappointed they don’t have the milder version of soup (like some sort of spicy level options) The matcha soft serve was really good it’s a must try 😊,2

I opted for the beef shank khao soi, and I can honestly say it was one of the best dishes I’ve had. The broth was incredibly rich and flavorful, perfectly balanced with a hint of spice that didn’t overwhelm the palate. The beef shank was cooked to perfection—tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. To complement my meal, I chose the butterfly pea tea, which was a delightful addition. Its natural sweetness paired beautifully with the savory khao soi, creating a harmonious dining experience. One notable feature was the helpful instructional card provided for those unfamiliar with how to enjoy khao soi. This thoughtful touch made the experience even more enjoyable and accessible to both locals and tourists alike. I also want to highlight the exemplary service from Aoffy, the hostess. She was incredibly kind and sweet, making sure I felt welcomed and comfortable. She spoke very good English, which made our conversation easy and enjoyable. Her initiative to chat with me when she noticed I was traveling alone added a warm and personal touch to my visit. Overall, Khao-Sō-i offers not just delicious food but also a wonderful atmosphere and friendly service. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Chiang Mai. Whether you're a khao soi aficionado or trying it for the first time, this place is a must-visit!",2

The atmosphere was sleek, calm and the open kitchen added a fun energy, watching the chefs prepare each bowl was a highlight. The khao soi itself was delicious, creamy, richly spiced broth, tender meat and perfectly cooked noodles. It’s more refined than street-style versions yet still deeply comforting. Service was professional and friendly. They even provide refillable drinks The place is almost always busy, which makes sense given the quality and clean, inviting decor. There’s a modern, elevated feel without being pretentious. Must have: Get the classic chicken khao soi. Rich, balanced and highly satisfying.

The setting is nice with a well formulated zen setting and general Japanese ambiance. The ordering process is also straightforward with pre-printed order sheets you simply write the number of dishes for each order. Presentation is also good with small wooden trays and dishes containing crispy noodles and chili paste etc. Superb quality ingredients are used and cooked to perfection. The umami flavours blend well and there's a good combination of flavours complementing one another. So excellent overall and worth a visit. Would I make it a regular visit? I'm afraid I probably won't on the simple basis of cost. There's equally flavorful and delicious khao soi available elsewhere in Chiang Mai and the surrounding villages but without the theatre and a third of the cost overall. You pay your money and take your choices - if your time is limited and you're seeking culinary experiences then this will fit right in.,7

I tried the northern sausage and it was interesting. I enjoy it. For the KaoSoi you can select the main topping first like pork, beef, seafood and etc. Then you choose the noodles to serve as a curry or dry. Personally, I like curry and surprisingly the pork rib one is my favorite. Their slow coof beef is a bit chewy for me. The portion is slightly Thai, not super full. The coffee cafe is nice and relaxing. There are dark and medium roster beans for your selection. All prices are acceptable and no additional charge. I parked at the nearby hotel and paid 40 Baht.

A bit crowded and some items are pricey but nothing that made my experience bad. I would come again. Overall this is a pretty unique Khao Soi restaurant that aims to elevate the classic Khao Soi. Food: the food is flavorful and a slightly different take on Khao soi while staying true to the classic flavors. I ordered the beef Khao soi and the noodles were good and slightly chewy, to my tastes. The soup is flavorful and the beef was tender. As an appetizer I ordered their signature dumplings and was very impressed. Each dumpling is filled with a lot of meat and the sauce has a nice tang to it. The presentation of the food is one of the most impressive parts and elevates the experience for me. There is also ice cream and a small cafe that’s part of the restaurant that I’ll touch on later. Service: The service seems efficient and good overall. Despite being packed with people they really try to get to everyone in time. They are polite and are always moving, asking if you want refills or anything. The place is often crowded. It the turnover rate is quite good so the wait isn’t that long. Once someone leaves the waiters and waitresses are quick to clean it and call in the next customer. Facilities and other: the bathroom is clean. There is an ice cream soft serve shop and a cafe that are a part of the restaurant adding to the experience. The ice cream is very cute albeit a bit pricey.",13

The founding chefs worked in Japan and France and the place was packed on a weekend and filled with locals. Food came really quickly and we really enjoyed the recommended options (khao soi soup with beef and stir fried khao soi dry). The curry was slightly sweet and it came with some broth and coconut milk to adjust the thickness of the soup to your preference. It was not too spicy, but we did request to tone down on the spiciness. The dumplings were recommended but not my favourite although the dipping sauce provided was excellent.

The khao soi was delicious and I love the noodles that they used. I feel it sticks better to the flavourful soup while not overpowering the flavour with too much carb. However, the joy of eating was shortlived because the eating area was very cramped and we were seated very closely to one another on all sides.

From people waiting in lines, to staff making order, to fill in menus, to meticulous toilets, to the attention to every detail such as the cutlery and the pottery, everything was perfect. And then, of course there is the food. The best Khao Soi I've ever eaten. The edge is not in the uniqueness of flavors, but in smoothing out every detail, until every part of the dish is perfect. Just go, just try it. The line of locals you see gathered in front of the shop, even though it's in the middle of nowhere, next to the highway, is proof enough of the quality of the food. And if you somehow happen not to like it, it's not a big waste, the food is still extremely cheap (for western standards at least). P.S. The Panna Cotta dessert was also perfect.

The rich, creamy curry broth, tender chicken, and perfectly cooked noodles create a symphony of flavors that’s both comforting and exciting. The crispy noodles on top add a delightful crunch, and the accompanying lime, pickled mustard greens, and red onions provide the perfect balance to the dish. Beyond Khao Soi, the menu is a treasure trove of traditional delights. Their Sai Ua (Northern Thai sausage) is bursting with aromatic herbs and spices, and the Nam Prik Noom (green chili dip) is a flavorful dip that’s a testament to Northern Thai cuisine. The staff at Khao Soi I are incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring every guest feels at home. The prices are also reasonable, making it accessible for travelers and locals alike. Khao Soi I isn’t just a meal; it’s an unforgettable journey into the heart of Northern Thailand’s rich culinary heritage. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Chiang Mai!",18

The stir-fried noodles were precooked and reheated, and the beef was torched, The beef actually no seasoning at all resulting in a blended taste. However, the worst part was that the noodles were cold, like leftover dishes from the previous night. Additionally, the soup version, the crackers were not crispy and had a harder texture. The curry broth was also served cold, and when I expressed my concerns about it being cold, the staff couldn't understand English properly. Instead of resolving the issue, they added even more cold broth to it. I understand that they wanted to modernize the traditional kao soi but it didn't work out well, and the pricing is twice as much as other places serving better kao soi. Overall not worth it.",18

Traditionally, the dough for the rice noodles is spread out on a cloth stretched over boiling water. After steaming the large sheet noodle is then rolled and cut with scissors. Lao khao soi is traditionally made with hand sliced rice noodles in clear soup broth and topped with minced pork and tomato sauce. In some markets in Luang Namtha and Muang Sing vendors still hand cut the noodles. These traditionally cut noodles can also be found in several places in northern Thailand.",23

They just reheat the precooked noodles. I understand that that’s how they prepped to cater to so many customers. But the noodles were way overcooked. The wagyu beef was torched so I couldn’t taste anything but propane gas.

But the khao soi was excellent and the staff was quite friendly and most spike English very well. In particular the manager? after the meal spoke to me for at least 10 minutes about the restaurant and the city. Super friendly gentleman. Also I very much enjoyed the gyoza. It was shaped like a traditional gyoza but the filling was definitely Thai. The Thai iced tea was so amazing I ordered an extra. The little soft serve ice cream booth outside was cute and tasty as well. The somewhat worst part of the meal is that since it is very busy you may have to wait a bit. I went at 2pm on a weekday and still waited about 20 min to eat by myself. I can't imagine how long a party of 4 would take to eat at noon. But otherwise one of my favorite meals in chiang mai.",35

Khao Soi is a traditional noodle dish from the northern part of Thailand. It consists of a noodle bowl with a rich curry sauce infused with herbs and curry paste, served with pickles, crispy noodles, and chili paste. Khao SO-I is a modern fusion of the flavors of Khao Soi with the artistry of Japanese Ramen. This restaurant has gained popularity in recent years, attracting many visitors to Chiang Mai eager to sample its special noodles. The restaurant is decorated in a Japanese style, with furniture and tools reflecting this theme. Food and drinks are also served in unique ceramic bowls, plates, and cups.

Dit restaurant heeft een luxe, moderne Japanse uitstraling, maar combineert dat moeiteloos met authentieke Noord-Thaise gerechten. Een geweldige mix van verfijning en traditie. Bij binnenkomst viel meteen de stijlvolle inrichting op: minimalistisch, warme houttinten en een ontspannen sfeer. De bediening was vriendelijk en professioneel, met veel kennis over de gerechten en drankjes. Geen overdreven formaliteit, gewoon oprecht gastvrij. De menukaart biedt een mooie balans tussen Japanse gerechten en lokale specialiteiten, waardoor je altijd iets bijzonders vindt. Ze gebruiken alleen verse, hoogwaardige ingrediënten, en dat proef je. We begonnen met een selectie Japanse hapjes – prachtig gepresenteerd en verfijnd van smaak. Daarna kozen we hun khao soi, en die was echt top: een luxe versie van het klassieke gerecht, met romige curry, perfect gegaard vlees en knapperige noodles. Daarnaast waren de sushi en sashimi heerlijk vers en tot in detail verzorgd. De cocktails en sake maakten de ervaring compleet. En de prijs? In Nederland zou je hier drie keer zoveel voor betalen. In Chiang Mai eet je op hoog niveau voor minder dan een McDonald’s-menu thuis. Alles klopte: de sfeer, het eten, de service en vooral de prijs-kwaliteitverhouding. Khao-Sō-i is een must-visit in Chiang Mai!",82

There was a bit of a lineup when we went in the evening. Food looked really good so, we decided to have dinner there. There are few tables, a lot of them actually, and there is an electronic wait list, very cool. There are not many options on the menu, just a few items. We ordered the shrimp and the pork options, dry and wet, respectively. We watched the food being made, very fresh and very quick. Both the dishes were excellent and tasted excellent, very tasty. Definitely a restaurant I would go back to.",1

Rumor has it this place has been firing up woks for decades The queue speaks Michelin vibes. The cook is a street-vendor-masterchef, and they run a fully computed cashier + ticket numbering system — because chaos must be managed when hungry humans descend. We joined a line that looked like a pool of polar bears sensing food in the arctic summer. If you’re already starving, please don’t start here—hangry breakdowns may occur. 🤣 ⏱ Our waiting time: 45 minutes 🎯 Our prize: Mixed Seafood and beef Suki Yaki — smoky, savory, slightly charred noodles with juicy prawns, squid and veggies. Best with a hint of spice from the chilly dip Top tip: While waiting, grab snacks and beers from the neighboring stalls or treat yourself to a bualoy (sweet glutinous rice balls) from the vendor opposite. It makes the line-watching and noodle-counting more meaningful.",1

The original branch can get very crowded, especially during peak hours. A good alternative is to visit another branch or order through a delivery app, the rider mentioned there’s even a special lane for delivery orders. • The overall taste is good, with the highlight being the quality of the meat and the smoky aroma from the pan-fried cooking style. • If you visit with normal expectations, it’s a 5-star experience, but if you come with high expectations, it might feel more like 3 stars.",1

However, this branch was a bit disappointing. I usually go to the Green Park branch the aroma from the pan there is much better, though the dipping sauce tastes the same.

This one is the original brunch that has been open for over 30 years. The queue would be long so we recommend reserving via the app QueQ in advance. My favorite is always Dried Suki with beef (extra) that is perfectly cooked and aroma smell of smoke. Meat is seasoned well and tender while veggies are also cooked well and crispy. The price is so reasonable with great ingredients. You can add more toppings like extra-meat, veggies or glass noodle as you desire.",1

Our hotel was nearby and while we were going to the pharmacy we passed by the night market. We were curious of the long queue and decided to try this one 😋 perfect for a chilly, rainy night. This was one of my favorite dish so far during my Thailand trip - I’m not a fan of spicy food. It’s a good thing that they’re providing a separate spicy condiment as to how you want your soup taste like. It’s nice to have a little kick by putting in some. 🙂 very tasty and pair up with Lookchin or Chang Beer!! 🍻",1

The hype is definitely real on this place. It is extremely busy every day of the week at every time they open up. So be prepared to wait at least 10-20 minutes for your order. But it is well worth it. The stir fried dish with pork is absolutely delicious and very cheap as well. Very tasty and very filling. Not too spicy but amazing in flavour. They got the whole system figured out with a wel organised line of people creating these great dishes. Eating there or take away are both amazing options. First order your dish and tell them if you want to be seated on the market or take it with you to eat wherever. Then watch how they go to work. An amazing street food vendor with the most delicious stir fry.,1

It has an insane line and it’s really not worth it. -1 for wait time Tastes like a random mix of everything thrown in together. Because that’s what it is. There’s not even a secret sauce or soup involved. Also it comes with a very minimal serving of noodles as a base - most of the contents are veggies. Would recommend getting the soup over the dry pot. It’s the same thing, except the soup one gives you an extra bag of soup.",1

It was around 8-9pm and had about 40 teams to wait …and was about more than an hour waiting time. Decided to get a take away instead, still waited about half an hour. It was worth waiting since I got to try the food. Delicious noodle and cabbages. Understand why so many people lined up to eat this dish. The following day I ordered another soup dishes through Grab.

Didn't need to wait long, number was called within 5 minutes, ordered a dry and a soupy one, paid and was appointed to a table. Food were quickly served and we preferred the dry one.

Despite being referred to as “suki,” this dish is more reminiscent of a Chinese hot pot. Ingredients like meats, vegetables, and glass noodles are stir-fried or boiled together, seasoned with a house-made sauce. Customers often rave about the stir-fried suki, which is cooked on a hot iron griddle, giving it a lightly smoky flavor and retaining the crunch of the vegetables. The dish is served with extra sauce, allowing diners to customize the flavor to their taste. Besides the suki stall, the Chang Phuak Gate Night Market is home to various other beloved stalls, including options for grilled mini-pork balls, roast duck, and traditional Thai desserts like rice dumplings in coconut milk.

Usually, sukiyaki is plain, tasteless, and full with some hard-to-eat veggies on the plate. However, seems like this Changphuak suki has selected fine vegetable part that is easy to eat, and cooked to its crispiness, so people could enjoy and eat comfortably. It doesn’t feel like you would have a to eat a whole plate of vegetables, it is as flavorful and easy to eat as that.

This was my second time coming back to Suki Chang Phueak, and honestly, it’s just as good as I remembered. The first time I tried their dry suki, I was blown away by the smoky aroma from the pan and the tender pork that practically melts in your mouth. Coming back this time, it was just as delicious. I came early in the evening, thinking I could avoid the crowd, but nope—still had to wait for nearly an hour. But let me tell you, it was absolutely worth it. Once the first plate arrived, the aroma hit me immediately, and the perfectly balanced flavor made all that waiting worthwhile. What makes this place even more special is that they’ve earned a Michelin award. With food this good, you’d expect higher prices, but it’s surprisingly affordable. If you love smoky, flavorful suki, this is a must-try. If you haven’t been here yet, I highly recommend it. Be prepared for the long wait, but trust me—it’s worth every second. Next time I’m in Chiang Mai, you can bet I’ll be coming back for round three!",21

I’d heard so much about this place and thought, How good could it really be? But since I was in Chiang Mai, I figured I might as well give it a try. So, I waited in line—just once in my life, I told myself. About 30 minutes later, I finally got a seat. Then, the suki arrived. And the moment I took my first bite? Game over. One visit was definitely not enough. This place isn’t just worth the wait—it’s worth coming back for again and again. The veggies were incredibly fresh, sweet, and crispy. The noodles had the perfect chew, and the egg clung beautifully to everything, soaking up that smoky wok aroma. Beef so tender it practically melted in my mouth. Honestly, the stir-fry was so flavorful on its own that it didn’t even need extra sauce. It was simply amazing. It’s been a week since I got back, and I’m still dreaming about Chang Phueak Suki. #chiangmai #localfood #localfoodinchiangmai #เชียงใหม่ #ร้านอร่อยบอกต่อ #ร้านอร่อยเชียงใหม่ #สุกี้ช้างเผือก #thaifood #sukichangphuak #สุกี้แห้ง",41

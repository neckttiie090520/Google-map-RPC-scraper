      "review_text": "Nice environment.. kao soy is nice but there are many others comparable to it. Went at a less busy period without many patrons. Plenty of staff standing around, unfortunately they seemed to be playing among themselves and not too interested in service. They are polite, don't get me wrong, but with the service button they are just waiting for it to buzz instead of proactively attending to customer. I had the shrimps of the Tom yum soup undercooked. I signalled one of the staff and used Google translate to let him know about it, and to help us to cook it a little more. He acknowledged it and walked away with the soup left on my table for another 5 minutes. I then signalled to a different staff and then this time he took the soup away. Not worth the hype. Come if its less crowded and if you are around the area. Honestly, plenty of stalls with similar if not better tasting noodles",

      "review_text": "This isn't my first time here at Kao Soy Nimman but it is my first time dropping the review. I've tried Kao soy from so many places around Chiang Mai, but honestly, Kao Soy Nimman is the best one yet. I get why it’s so famous...and now I 100% agree with all the hype 👍 The broth is rich, creamy, not too thick or liquidly and it's full of flavor, the noodles are perfectly cooked, and that crispy topping adds the perfect crunch. Everything just comes together so well. **Don't underestimate their chilli** Even though it’s already super popular with both locals and tourists, it really deserves the extra fame. If you’re in Chiang Mai and want to taste the best Kao Soy OR Khao Soi, this is the spot. Totally recommend! 👍",

The Khao Soi had rich standard coconut curry broth, crispy noodles on top, and super tender chicken. The balance of spice, creaminess, and a squeeze of lime was just perfect. The Satay Peanut Noodles were such a nice surprise!!!! creamy, nutty, slightly sweet, with grilled chicken that had that smoky flavor 9/10. A great fusion of comfort food and Thai street style. Nice cozy spot with warm Chiang Mai vibes. Perfect for anyone who loves flavorful northern Thai food. Highly recommend adding this place to your food list when you’re in town! Food looks as good as it tastes check the photos that I took here.",

      "review_text": "This restaurant deserves to get its first Michelin star! All the products were not only very tasty, but the products also contained a unique blend of Norhern Thai-style flavors (which are in my opinion the better dishes of Thailand). We felt really treated like kings. The service was impeccable and no waiting thanks to the digital bell on our dining table. As a starter, we ate the soft, creamy and scrumptious eggplant salad, which I can really recommend to vegetarians. Also the chicken skewers with satay sauce was a great addition to our order, with a wink to the original chicken-satay skewers from Indonesia. Even the pickled veggies let me think of the Indonesian dishes for a while. However, I have to confess that I personally prefer an Indonesian-style satay sauce. For our main course we had a great stir-fried chicken dish with a great combination of spices. To add more spice to our dinner, we had the delicious Kang Nor curry dish. I really like this curry for the added bamboo sprouts and dried fish. As a non-pork eater, I obviously chose this fish-variety. However, they also have a pork-variety. My boyfriend and I were seated inside. The restaurant was well climatized and very clean. You could even look through the glass, where you could see the diligent people working hard to make exquisite dishes. Even the dining tables were of another kind of level. At the end of our dinner we realized that we had been sitting on a ‘remade’ authentic sewing table. It gives the restaurant so much more atmosphere. As a dessert, I ate colored soft noodles in sweet coconut milk. I must say that this type of dessert, has it all to me. We went to our hotel totally satisfied, joyful and fully fed. I can assure everyone that you will enjoy your meal here to the highest level!",

Its consistency struck the right note as well, being neither too thick nor too watery. The two types of noodles, one firm and the other soft, added depth and variety to each bite. Midway through, the topping of lemon slices, onions, and pickled vegetables refreshed the flavor, making the bowl enjoyable from start to finish. Although about ten people were waiting outside, our turn came in just around 20 minutes.",

The portions are VERY small and the price is high for what they offer. I found this khao soi very mediocre. It’s not bad. It is just nothing special at all. I believe this place is overrated and I had a feeling it would be… but I decided to give it a try and believe in the reviews. I was wrong. People keep coming because there are some good reviews and, if they had not had a chance of actually having a good thai meal or a rich khao soi, they would think this one is good. Believe me, its not. And if you come to this restaurant and there is a line, dont wast your precious time.",

After being seated, we had to call someone after 15 minutes because no one seemed to want to take our order. No hello. The staff waits for orders with their arms behind their backs against trees or walls. We chose to try the kao soy because we know it well. What a surprise when the dish arrived, we would have said half a portion with say 5 tablespoons of sauce maximum. Also, we decided to try a dessert. Likewise, no one came to ask us if we wanted something... yet many staff were available and we had to call them. And as you can see from the pictures, no one cleared the meal / table before and during dessert. There are other places much better in terms of taste, service and price in Chang Mai.",

      "review_text": "1350 for 3 different Kao soy, 2 mixed platters and calamari. Everything was nice enough except the calamari. Kao soy was like a Malaysian curry mee (not laksa) with a thicker and plainer broth. The noodles and crunch is nice though. The silkworms were nice and crispy with a bit of salt flavour. Northern Thai sausage platter was average in textures and taste but the dips made up for it. The chicken satay was nice enough but nothing special. The black rice is like a Bak chang so not a fan. Pork floss and onion ring were quite nice. Pork rind was normal. Calamari batter was not sticking and while crispy lacked flavour. Service was a bit slow when getting the bill. Had to ask 3 different people before we got the bill.",

The octopus was chewy, not salty and a little bougie in the best way laying on top of a coconut curry hot tub. Then came the classic hero: the Chicken Khao Soi. A+ comfort food. That broth? Creamy, warm, just the right punch of spice. At some parts, the slurping was wishing the broth had just one more ladle of richness. Ended with a tropical pool party where the Thub Thim Krob came in like a treasure chest disguised as a dessert bowl.Signature ruby water chestnuts (crunchy, chewy, glorious) Grass jelly, cendol, and nata de coco and golden jackfruit pieces all vibing in one icy, sweet coconut milk party. Was definitely pleasing to the eyes but flavour wise went a little under. Still—worth the visit, especially if you’re khao soi-curious or full-on obsessed with the michelin adventure! Zoom off with a grab-bike ride that gives u more than local vibes 😉",

Attitude felt somewhat indifferent, falling short of Michelin-level expectations. ⚠️ Food Was Decent – Good enough for a casual meal, but not necessarily worth standing in a long queue for. In short, KAO SOY NIMMAN is a nice place to casually enjoy northern Thai noodles, but those expecting attentive service might need to adjust their expectations.",

      "review_text": "Ate dinner here 3 times on 5 days trip in Chiang mai, had Beef Kaosoi and chicken satay, both were amazing. Kao soi came out really quick , but chicken satay took much long to make as it is a grilled chicken (It's normal in Thailand that the food won't come at the same time , they serve whatever is ready first) Some of the day, I felt like the broth tasted spicer, but still really good. I'm originally from Thailand and as many people mentioned , it may not be the most authentic Kaosoi, however, I had Kaosoi from many places in Thailand and the problem is I found many of them feel too heavy for my stomach and made me feel unwell after the meal, but for this place I can truly enjoy my meal so this place my favorite 👍 Also, It's true that this place is more expensive compared to many other local vendors where you can find Kao soi for for 50-70 bath, but the quality of their meat is much better, well worth the price in my opinion!",

Tables were re-purposed from old sewing machines. Eight of us had a bowl of the famous Kao Soy Kai (curry noddlenwith chicken leg), as well as some side dishes to share: steamed herbal beef shank, chicken satay, kai jeow moo sab (minced pork Thai omelette). The Kao Soy Kai is a mixture of crispy noodle and normal yellow noodle. Blended well curiously. The ingredients were fresh, and the meat dishes were cooked well. We also ordered a drink each, and some dessert to share. Disappointed that the mango sticky rice was sold out. Price wise, it is reasonable: total of about 2,800 baht or 350 baht per person.",

The Super Bowl featured an assortment of grilled pork, chicken leg, and squid which offers a creamy, slightly sweet coconut-curry broth with firm egg noodles is approachable for newcomers, though purists might miss traditional depth. Portions are generous, and seating was immediate during our 2pm visit. Don’t skip the aromatic chicken satay skewers - tender white meat with a zesty chili-shallot dip. Highlights include the crab shell roe (tiny but intensely savory) and the peeled coconut—a refreshing, Instagrammable orb in a chilled metal cup. The vibe is energetic, with English menus and swift service, though prices lean higher than local joints. The ambience was pretty with all the overhanging ferns and plants however seated outdoors, there were a little too many flies around for comfort. Small eaters can share the Super Bowl (it’s huge!), skip the crab roe unless craving novelty, and visit mid-afternoon to avoid crowds. Ideal for first-timers seeking a hassle-free Kao Soi experience, but seasoned diners might prefer hole-in-the-wall authenticity. Still, a solid choice for flavorful, filling meals in a vibrant setting.",

From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was inviting and cozy, with a delightful blend of traditional Thai decor and efficient but unattractive (to the point) service —we got no help with recommendations and had to call service several times. 🌿✨ Let's start with the beverages. Despite their small selection, the fresh coconut water was refreshing, and the tea was perfect for the appetizers. 🍹🍵 The regular beers were also cold and refreshing. As for the food, it was truly spectacular! Each dish was a testament to Thai culinary craftsmanship. The “Mo Wah Pork Jerky” was expertly done, with a perfect caramelization that added a delightful sweetness and crunch to every bite. 🍖💎 The highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the “Kai Soy Stewed Beef.” The creamy sauce was nothing short of delicious, and the beef was tender and flavorful, melting in our mouths with each bite. It was a dish that left us craving more. 🍲🐄 We also ordered the “Pork Beef Grilled,” which, although flavorful, had a bit more fat than we preferred. However, the rich taste of the meat more than compensated for this slight inconvenience. 🥩🔥 Overall, \"Kao Soy Nimman\" delivered a mixed dining experience, with nice Thai food but regular service and restaurant atmosphere. We would recommend it when looking for something quick and delicious, no fancy or exotic ! 🌟🇹🇭 Pros: - Delicious and well-prepared dishes 🍽️ - Quick service - Inviting and cozy atmosphere 🌿 - Authentic Thai flavors 🇹🇭 Cons: - Short selection of beverage 🍹 - Brief and to the point service, unattractive or unwelcoming (we had to ask constantly, empty plates were there until asked to be removed)",

When we paid our bill and the waiter saw that we gave back two full plates of food he didn’t even ask if anything was wrong with it. To top it all off I had a belly ache the whole night which I’ve never had before here in Thailand after eating. Two stars and not one because the Passion fruit juice and chicken Sate were good.",

The food is good and we enjoyed it especially the grilled beef (though you can get way cheaper and just as tasty at the street food carts) but the Kao Soy was underwhelming. I had the Kao Soy Super Bowl and the prawns (aka shrimp) in it had a papery texture like when you freeze and defrost seafood. Didn’t taste fresh. The chicken drumstick in there was moist but was surprisingly bland and lacked the flavour I have come to expect from northern Thai food. The broth was nice and spicy and overall it was a tasty meal but just not worth the very long wait and the prices (we got 4 dishes and 3 drinks). The best Kao Soy we had was one we made ourselves at Mama Noi Thai Cookery School so definitely try that out if you’re a foodie. You’ll get delicious food and learn how to make it on your own whilst having a fun experience. If you really want to try the food here then maybe order it to go so you can pick it up later without having to sit around waiting or see if you can order it to be delivered to your accommodation via Grab.",

This was fine, there was no pressure to 'free' the table, we had drinks while we waited.. 1 x beer and 1 x Grass Jelly Juice (A strange drink as it came in a bowl filled with ice and jelly strips that resembles slugs and a dark liquid, but it was quite refreshing - needed both a straw and a spoon). Our friends arrived, and food was ordered.... 3 x Kao Soy Stewed Beef, 1x Kao Soy Poo-Nim ( which is a soft-shelled crab dish), Sai Oua (this is spicy sausage), Kai Satay (chicken on skewers with peanutbutter sauce). More drinks: another Beer, Soda Water and 2 x Passion Fruit Juices. The dishes were delicious.. really good fresh, tasty food. The prices seemed reasonable, we did eat a lot (a dish each and 2 shared dishes plus 1 or 2 drinks each) and the bill came to baht 1275.. that's about baht 320 each. The atmosphere was lively, there was a lot of staff around to help, and they were so polite and efficient. We will be returning to try other dishes on the menu.",

Young and soft coconut meat for the first order but old and very hard meat for the second order. There is a service bell on the table. Funny sound of pressing it, lol. Tried a few time but no waiter responded to it. You still have to wave your hands for service. Beware of mosquitoes bites if you sit outside. Bathroom is quite terrible. Dirty sewage everywhere.",

We also ate another Spicy Chicken with bamboo shoots, not much to eat tho almost all the ingredients are spices or things for cooking. Anyhow I definitely recommend the place for people visiting the city for the first time and you want to sit in a vibrant area with a great atmosphere.",

You can order it almost any way that you like, with or without meat. They offer Kao Soi with tofu, mushrooms, or just vegetables for all of us vegetarians. There are other vegetarian options on their menu, also. We really enjoyed the vegetable Thai omelette! Very delicious! It’s a busy place because it is so popular, so arrive early if you don’t like to wait. Service was very good because every table has a call button for the waiters, and they always respond almost immediately. Prices were very good, too. We will definitely return here and recommend this place to others.",

      "review_text": "This wasn't the best Khao Soi I've had in Chiang Mai; the broth seemed a bit bland. The prices here are quite high compared to other places but if you want to try a place on the Michelin guide you pay the price. They charge you for a bowl of ice about 20 baht. Very famous among tourists and can be crowded during lunch. We had to wait in a queue for about 40 mins. Besides the signature Khao Soi, we ordered several side dishes. The crispy pork skewers tasted quite good but not crispy, we had the mango sticky rice, the portion is huge but taste was just average. However, the dining environment is nice. This place is quite famous, but I think it's overrated.",

Michelin recognition attests to its quality and consistent appeal among locals and tourists. Khao soi itself is significant in Chiang Mai and Northern Thailand, known for its coconut-based curry broth, rich spices, and soft-crunchy noodle texture. A unique fusion of Thai and Burmese culinary influences, khao soi is cherished as a warm, hearty dish and has become an iconic part of Chiang Mai’s food culture, symbolizing local heritage and flavor. While it’s tourist-friendly and conveniently located, some visitors feel it’s slightly pricier than local spots nearby. It’s a recommended stop for travelers looking to try authentic Thai flavors.",

The Fried squid was also very tasty and crunchy and pretty large! I loved the functionality to push a button and get a server quickly. Also, they DO accept credit cards unlike the donut and tea place right outside the restaurant.",

It's become well-known after being featured in the Michelin Bib Gourmand list. I visited around 4 PM on a Sunday, and since I opted for the terrace seating, there was no wait. Despite Chiang Mai's 38°C heat, the fans on the terrace kept things pleasantly cool. I ordered the classic chicken Khao Soi, which arrived with thick boiled noodles topped with crispy fried noodles and cilantro. A separate plate with purple onions, pickled cabbage, and lime was also provided. The soup has a coconut-based Thai curry flavor. Initially mild, it develops a delightful spicy kick as you eat, making it quite addictive. The thick noodles soak up the soup beautifully, making each bite irresistible. The crispy noodles can be enjoyed either plain or dipped in the soup, offering a nice contrast in texture. The bone-in chicken topping was tender and fell apart easily with chopsticks, making it very easy to eat. I added all the purple onions, pickled cabbage, and lime to the soup during the meal, and each addition complemented the soup perfectly, keeping it flavorful and exciting until the very end. I ended up finishing every bit of the soup! It’s a Khao Soi I’d crave even after returning to Japan. 🍜✨ 🍜カオソーイ・ガイ 85バーツ(約420円) チェンマイのニマンヘミン周辺にある人気のカオソーイ店。ミシュランビブグルマンに選出されたことで有名になったそう。 日曜16時頃の訪問でテラス席であれば待ちなしで入れた。38℃のチェンマイだがテラスでも扇風機がよく効いていて気持ちよく食べられる。 定番の鶏肉カオソーイを注文すると、太めの茹で麺の上にトッピングで揚げ麺、パクチーが乗って到着。別皿で紫玉ねぎ、キャベツの漬物？、ライムがついてくる。 スープはココナッツベースのタイ風のカレー味。最初はマイルドだが後からしっかりスパイスの辛さを感じられて病みつきになる😳 太めの麺にスープがとってもよく絡んでグイグイ食べ進めてしまう🥹 揚げ麺もそのまま食べたりスープに浸して食べることで食感の違いを楽しめる。 トッピングの骨付きチキンも柔らかくて箸でホロホロ崩れるのでとっても食べやすかった🍗🤍 紫玉ねぎ、キャベツの漬物、ライムを途中で全て入れてみたがどれもスープとの相性が良すぎて飽きずに食べられ、 スープを完飲してしまいました😍 日本に帰国しても食べたくなるカオソーイでした🍜✨",

      "review_text": "We stumbled upon Kao Soy Nimman while taking a walk, drawn in by its charming decor. The restaurant offers plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors. Despite arriving at 4 PM, there were quite a few groups enjoying their meals. It was only later that we realized this place is Michelin-recommended—a pleasant surprise! We opted to sit outdoors, though indoor seating with air conditioning was available. Despite the hot weather, the standing fans kept the outdoor area comfortably cool. Initially, we planned to just have dessert, but the signature Khao Soi on the menu looked too appealing to resist, so we decided to share a bowl. We're glad we did! The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the Thai lime, onion, and salted vegetables added a unique twist that elevated the dish. For dessert, we ordered two options: the Passion and what I believe is called Chendo (though I’m not certain of the name). I preferred the Passion drink, which was refreshingly cool, though it wasn't as sour as I expected—it could have benefited from a stronger passion fruit flavor.

      "review_text_translated": "We stumbled upon Kao Soy Nimman while taking a walk, drawn in by its charming decor. The restaurant offers plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors. Despite arriving at 4 PM, there were quite a few groups enjoying their meals. It was only later that we realized this place is Michelin-recommended—a pleasant surprise! We opted to sit outdoors, though indoor seating with air conditioning was available. Despite the hot weather, the standing fans kept the outdoor area comfortably cool. Initially, we planned to just have dessert, but the signature Khao Soi on the menu looked too appealing to resist, so we decided to share a bowl. We're glad we did! The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the Thai lime, onion, and salted vegetables added a unique twist that elevated the dish. For dessert, we ordered two options: the Passion and what I believe is called Chendo (though I’m not certain of the name). I preferred the Passion drink, which was refreshingly cool, though it wasn't as sour as I expected—it could have benefited from a stronger passion fruit flavor. The Chendo had a variety of ingredients, but it wasn't as fragrant or flavorful as similar desserts we’ve had back home. Overall, I really enjoyed our visit and would love to return to try more of their dishes. The ambiance, food, and service made for a delightful experience.",

The platter of sausage and vegetable is nice, I particularly like the saugage. Dessert is decent too.",

The satay chicken skewers were quite good, but the rest were just average. Especially the desserts and ice cream, which we didn't finish.

Remember to dig in their northern Thai sausages when you are there because it’s a must eat to me too! Khao Soi taste like curry noodle with the flat egg noodle, served with whichever meat you pick and lots of “wanton” skin which is my fav 😋 it’s not too spicy for me (I’m a Singaporean that usually don’t eat spicy food) Loved their dessert as they are pretty generous with the fillings, it has a flower taste to it besides having the main coconut taste. A must have for a HOT day 🤭",

The restaurant is beautiful, open air, and cool roofing to give it a garden vibe. They obviously specialize in khao soi - we grabbed stewed beef and chicken to compare. Both were creamy and coconuty with a delightful kick of spice, a blend of crunchy and chewy yellow noodles and tender meat (the beef just melts in your mouth) Drinks were refreshing and the Thai sausage was unfortunaly a miss - a bit on the dry side and packed full of spices, I found myself having to wash it down with water constantly. Overall a great experience! :)",

      "review_text": "We visited this restaurant twice, and both the food and the environment were great! However, by local standards, the pricing was indeed a bit on the higher side. We ordered the Khao Soi Stewed Beef, where the beef absorbed the delicious curry sauce, making it very flavorful, and the noodles were more elastic and chewy compared to others we've had elsewhere. We also tried the Rod Duan (fried bamboo worms), which had no strange taste but were instead filled with a bran-like aroma. We originally wanted to order grilled chicken, but customers at the next table who had ordered grilled chicken/pork/beef recommended we try the grilled beef, which proved to have an excellent flavor. Additionally, we tried the Thai Boiled Wild Mushrooms (Nam Prik Kha Hed Tob), which had a crisp texture and could be dipped in the provided Galangal Chili sauce, though I found that sauce to be a bit too spicy for me. For drinks, we tried Pennywort juice, Gardenia flower juice, and shelled coconut. Each had its unique flavor, but the portion sizes were quite small given the price. We avoided peak hours to escape the crowd and potential wait times, so during our visits, there were more servers than customers. They were all very enthusiastic and patient in introducing us to the dishes, and they responded quickly whenever we had questions or needed to add an order. If your travel budget isn’t too tight, we highly recommend giving this place a try.",

      "review_text": "Checked out Kao Soy Nimman, a spot that's got a nod from Michelin, so you know it's got some serious creds. True to the hype, the place was packed, with a no-reservations policy meaning you grab a number and hang tight for your turn. Dropped by on a weekday, post-lunch rush around 2pm, and still clocked a 40-minute wait. Went straight for their namesake dish, the Kao Soy. Pretty tasty, though it leaned towards the saltier side - flavor lovers would be into it. The chicken BBQ was alright, nothing to write home about. Price-wise, it's a winner, and the vibe of the restaurant is pretty chill, albeit super busy. They could do with a few more hands on deck, as getting the bill took a bit of effort and a couple of reminders. Was the wait worth it? Depends on your mood and schedule. If you're looking to kill some time and escape the heat, it's not a bad option. But if you're not up for the wait, maybe swing by during off-peak hours.",

The food wasn't bad, but I don't think it deserved a star. My wife came here last year and said the food went downhill compared to now. Even my favorite Kow Soi place has decreased in quality after getting a Michelin star. Again, it wasn't bad, but it should've been better. Oh and why tease me with a beautiful picture in the menu of Kow Soi duck if you don't actually serve duck?!?",

I think it's because of peak hour, the staff are all busy to approach us, so we kind of wait for some time for the table and also ordering. We ordered two different types of Kao Soy, the taste is okay but doesn't taste any spicy, we are not sure what the taste is supposed to be because this is our first time having Kao Soy 😄 Not to mention, the dessert can taste the ice from the icebox 😂 Again, we are not sure if that is 'normal' tastes? Overall it is okay, will try the other Kao Soy restaurant in future.",

I found the noodles rather soggy but that could be my personal preference (I like my noodles al dente). Soup was alright. Chicken skewers were tender but salty. Dessert with assorted toppings was tasty and refreshing. Outdoor seating can be quite warm. Staff can speak basic English (they could not understand my request not to give me a straw for the dessert)",

I am thoroughly impressed with the consistency in the flavor. Khao Soi's taste is still delicious, and the best part is that it comes at an affordable price, making it truly a great value for money. The restaurant's Khao Soi brings back nostalgic memories of local cuisine. Their secret recipe has been kept intact, maintaining the authentic flavors of Chiang Mai. The aroma of the broth is rich, and the perfect level of spiciness adds to the irresistible allure of this dish. Apart from Khao Soi, their other dishes are also worth trying. Overall, this restaurant offers a good balance of quality and affordability. The service is friendly and efficient, further enhancing the dining experience. In conclusion, I highly recommend this restaurant once again. If you wish to savor authentic flavors of Chiang Mai, this place is an excellent choice. Their Khao Soi continues to be one of my favorite dishes, offering a delightful combination of taste and value. I look forward to revisiting this delightful eatery.",

The Khao Soy is just okay the noodles a bit hard for my taste. The spring rolls are surprisingly better than I expected. The dishes seemed not spicy compared to other places. Also I like the bowl they use for drinks, didn't see anywhere else in Chiangmai. So I think Kao Soy Nimman is a nice option for those who want to try local foods that are adjusted to tourists taste, the location is also a plus, well located close to Onenimman.",

At some corner of the very thick menu lies a picture of the crab brullee. It's like baked uni but for a fraction of the price. Pretty random find but just wow.

First weird thing is that they close already at 8pm and we were rushed to leave the place as we arrived just after 7pm for s dinner. The searing was very uncomfortable and the service was not very attentive, we had to wave at the waiter multiple times so they finally notice us and we can order the food. The food was probably worst I had in any restaurant in Chiang Mai, maybe we just picked wrong but out of three meals, every one of them was not tasteful at all. The noodles which were supposed to be non spicy were spicy as hell. Not sure, maybe we just picked a wrong day and everything went badly for us.",

      "review_text": "This was a Michelin guide 2020 restaurant recommended to us from a Chiang Mai local. We waited a good 30 minutes but they churn people through the restaurant pretty quickly. The khao soi was absolutely delicious. I got the pork belly Khao soi and the pork belly melts in your mouth. The soup base had lots of herbs and spices with a little bit of curry based influenced. My favorite part was how the noodles were both crispy and soft. Soft for the parts in the soup and crispy for the pieces above it. I loved that combination of textures in this dish. We also got some delicious sides, calamari, chicken satay, and dumplings. All very good. So overall it was totally worth the wait and the prices are fair. Would 100% recommend going here.",

      "review_text": "My husband loves khao soi, so we were on the hunt for the best khao soi in town, and saw the great reviews on this place! Although not the best khao soi, it was pretty delicious! When we got there around lunch time, there was a huge line up! We contemplated waiting or not, but ultimately decided to since we were there anyways and we really wanted to try this place out. We got our number from the hostess and she told us there were 20 numbers ahead of us so we were prepared to wait for at least an hour. There is a bubble tea place right beside it so we ordered a bubble tea while we waited. To our surprise, the wait only took about 25 minutes! We got seated in the air-conditioned space at the back, which was good because it was such a hot day out! I ordered the chicken khao soi, my husband ordered the beef khao soi, and we also got the crispy wontons and steamed vegetables to share. The food came within 10 minutes, which was very reasonable. The khao soi tasted quite good, just the right amount of richness, and not too spicy. Since this place is so popular among tourists, we felt that perhaps the dish was not truly authentic, compared to some other khao soi we have tried. Delicious food nonetheless! The food was definitely tourist pricing since it was pricier than most other local restaurants, but we expected that going in so no surprises there. I would definitely return to this place if I find myself in Chiang Mai again, but I’d probably try to go a bit earlier to avoid the lunch time rush.",

I also ordered the \"northern style pork curry made with peanuts, garlic and ginger\" which tasted ok but was quite mild flavoured and watery + half of the curry was fat and skin (again I kind of expected just pork meat - as shown in the picture in their menu). Considering this wasn't a cheap meal, I was overall disappointed in the quality. To make matters worse, I ordered delivery to my hotel and was sent no cutlery so I had to run around to 7-11 to ask for a tiny plastic spoon, made for stirring coffee\". Food was cold by the time I got round to opening it up. Dont think i'll be ordering from this place again!",

Even seating outdoors, there's no pesky mosquitoes. There are many wait staff and they are attentive and helpful. There's a toilet and free wifi. However when it comes to the food, it's mediocre and i have had better khao soi in the basement of a fresh market and much cheaper too. The khao soi here is served in a porcelain bowl with the pickle, onion and lime wedge in a separate metal dish. One taste of the noodle, the soup was not hot(merely warm), noodle was too soft and the curry tasted a tad too sweet(not sour enough even with the lime). I ordered the thai omelette khao soi, the omelette itself was good and the fried egg noodles on top of the bowl were perfectly crispy and crunchy so props for those. Overall forgettable khao soi and it was more expensive than average (starts at 69 thb. I have had better khao soi at 40 thb). I went past the kitchen and noticed a big vat of curry boiling away on the stove so it doesn't make sense that it's merely warm. I then ordered a dessert(water chestnut with rubies in iced coconut milk) 40 thb. It came in a plastic container with a plastic straw and spoon stuck in the container. I try to avoid single use plastics and always have with me my own cutlery. Such an upscale place and they use single use plastics and chopsticks. Disappointing. (Returning the plastics will only be thrown in the bin so even worse)",

Kao Soy Nimman is a Michelin bib gourmand place which has definitely earned it much fame among tourists. We had to line up for about 30 minutes before being given a table, which isn’t a problem in itself. However, ONCE we got inside and placed our orders (one bowl of khao soi and one omelette), it took 40 minutes before the khao soi arrived. We made several requests to the staff about where our food was, but no one ever seemed to be able to definitively help. The khao soi took 40 minutes to arrive, but we waited about 70 minutes for the omelette and it never came. We ultimately decided we had spent too long in the restaurant, asked the waitress if we could cancel our omelette request (to which she kindly said yes), paid up and left. As for the khao soi, it was extremely bland and watered down, and the meat was tough and chewy. I have since eaten at Khao Soi Maesai and Khao Soi Lung Prakit Kad Kom (both Michelin bib gourmand places too), and their khao soi was incomparably better and the quality of the meat was far superior too. Not to mention, the prices at this restaurant are 3x those at the other two, but for what reason? This isn’t an agenda-driven review by any means, but simply an honest reflection of what I experienced. I hope it is helpful, especially to those of you who are considering visiting on a tight time schedule - you will not miss anything important by skipping this place.",

The food was poorly prepared and lacked the authentic flavors that this region is known for. On top of that, the service was inattentive and unwelcoming, making the experience even more disappointing. I had hoped for a memorable meal, but this left a bad impression instead. There are plenty of better options in Chiang Mai that offer both great food and friendly service. I cannot recommend this place based on my visit.",

There were plenty of empty tables available, at least 4 (refer to my photos), when we arrived, but we weren’t seated until 20 mins later which shows they just aren’t very efficient with managing things. Also, there were 4-5 employees wearing orange shirts whose job is to take orders from customers (you can’t scan a QR code to order by yourself) but only 1-2 of them were working and the other employees were just slacking off. So when I gestured to have my order taken, one of them would look at another, expecting their colleague to take responsibility and that repeated a few times, and so I had to wait a few minutes to even have someone come over and take our order. Also, their queuing system is not clear at all. There should a sign at the entrance that clearly states that you need to collect a blue ticket from one of their employees. Overall, I thought the food was quite average and not worth what you pay for (a bill for 2 came to 525 baht, and the service wasn’t great, and you will most likely have to queue to eat here, and so I definitely would say it’s not worth your time and energy to eat such average food.",

Both dishes arrived within 5 minutes after my order even though the place was packed full, props for that. A point reduction for the portion size of the Khao Soi though. I‘m a big guy, but usually I‘m full after one Khao Soi, not so here, it felt like half a portion and with very little soup. Oh, and when I wanted to order a beer they told me beer was sold out (at 7pm), which I found was strange… Both dishes cost about 120 baht each.",

We ordered nam prik het gap pak (not the actual name of the dish but I'm farang) along with one steamed rice. The order arrived a nice selection of vegetables but they were limp and tasteless where they had been cooked to long and they werent seasoned. The dip was OK but didn't taste fresh and was not very spicy. The waiting staff bought sticky rice first of all when we ordered steamed so we sent it back, then they bought out to 2 steamed rice where we ordered one so we sent one back. At 8.15 we were told that the restaurant was closing and we should order now if we wanted anything else, the restaurant advertises that it closes at 9pm,, customers continued to come in for a further 25 minutes and were given tables (reluctantly) at this.point we decided to ask for the bill, 15 minutes later the bill had not arrived so we asked again, a further 5 minutes and the bill arrived. I put cash in the holder and waited and 10 minutes later we called someone over and paid our bill. Nobody was overseeing the lazy waiters all of them young men. This is the first time.i have not left a tip in Thailand. I was recommended the khao soi here so I will go back band try it but if then owners are reading this they need to address the experience before more negative reviews roll in. The spicy sausage was very nice.",

The downside is the spring rolls were a bit oily, but they were quite crispy. We thought this place was OK, but not a favorite here.",

Being with a local... The dishes we ordered were Thai and from the region ( dishes you could any found in the Chang Mai region). Taking about the food, we did enjoy is sooo much ! It was truly good and tasty. The service was excellent 👌👍 and fast! The garden atmosphere brings a lot and we found it cosy and quiet. We ordered a lot to be honest and we were starving but also enjoying... And when the bill came... We were shocked how so NOT EXPENSIVE it was! 850 TBH for 10 dishes plus drinks plus deserts.... is definitely more that reasonable! We can only recommend this place! Worth it 🙂",

Fortunately we came at a time where there was no wait. While we were waiting for our food, people waited. But they waited under an umbrella for max 10 minutes. There is indoor seating and outdoor (covered) seating. My husband ordered the Khao with Thai sausage, which was tasty. I ordered a Northern style curry with pork (very tender. But they had small pieces of bone, which I found annoying to bit around) with jackfruit. It wasn't a coconut milk curry, so don't expect it to be creamy. This dish wasn't my first pick, I would have preferred the hung-le pork curry. But after I placed my order, they told me they didn't have it. I would expect a twice nominated Michelin star restaurant, they would know what they have in stock before people place their order. To drink we had the roselle juice and butterfly pea flower with lime juice. Both were very delicious and served with shiny silver cups. We enjoyed our time here but it would have been better had I gotten the dish I wanted in the first place.",

They are simply hanging out and slacking away on their phones. When I went in, none greeted me or gave me a table.

The queue was really long even at 2pm, but the turnover was quick enough to get us a table within 10 minutes, aided by their expansion to a neighbouring shophouse's yard. We had a big khao soi that had a bit of everything in it and a standard bowl of beef khao soi, an extremely crispy fried egg with minced pork (wanted to try the ant eggs but the wife declined), and another bowl of soupy bamboo shoots with meat in it. As most of the food in the extensive menu (including a more exotic bamboo worms) were spicy, they provided a free plate of fried rice for our young daughter. To beat the heat, we ordered an interesting globe of dehusked coconut flesh with the juice in it, an iced chrysanthemum drink complete with a decorative flower, and a dessert reminiscent of chendol from Singapore and Malaysia. All in all, the food was pretty good, though it must be said that khao soi being a curry based staple dish in Chiangmai, is not necessarily for everyone.",

Chicken satay, chicken is tender, but the satay sauce tastes like nothing. Spring rolls, nothing special. I’m not sure what I am eating. Northern style spicy sausage, average. Nothing special. Stir fried Gunymnma in oyster sauce, it’s okay, some local veggies I think. Tom yum goong, this one is really weird, 3-4 big pieces of ginger and just a few shrimp, and it’s 185 THB???? Green chicken curry with rice noodles, green curry sauce tastes like water, not worth it. Just somewhere I wouldn’t visit again, so many vendors on streets are better. I don’t know why people recommend this place. We can’t even use credit card to pay. Lol Oh by the way, they charge ice for 20 THB. Haha",
